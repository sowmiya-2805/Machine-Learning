#Flight-delay-prediction
This project deals with a two stage machine learning model which classifies whether a flight is delayed or not in the first stage and predicts the duration of delay in the second stage. 

This project is seggregated into 4 modules as follows,
    1. Data preprocessing - Involves processing the raw data files of flight and weather and combining them into a single 'csv' files.
    2. Classification - Involves feature extraction and balancing the classes in the initial phase. The final phase consists of concluding the best performing classifier.
    3. Regression - Involves extracting the results from the best performing classifier and using them to perform regression tasks. The final phase consists of regression analysis to analyze how well the best concluded regressor works on the data.
    4. Inference - Involves concluding the results from the machine learning models.
